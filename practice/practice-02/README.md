## Technical

- [HTML5](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html5/html5_overview.htm): CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) consist of a group of formatting rules that you use to control the layout and appearance of the content on a web page.
- [CSS3](https://www.htmlgoodies.com/html5/an-overview-of-css3/): Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to illustrate a document’s look, style, and format in any markup language. In simple words, it is used to style and organize the layout of Web pages. CSS3 is the latest version of an earlier CSS version, CSS2.
- [Pugjs](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html): Pug.js is a template engine for Node.js and browsers to render dynamic reusable content. At compile time, the template engine compiles our Pug template code to HTML.
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/): Scss is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.
